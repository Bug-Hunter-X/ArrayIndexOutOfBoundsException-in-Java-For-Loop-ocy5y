This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The bug arises from an off-by-one error in a `for` loop that iterates over an array. The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate over an array in Java to avoid this exception.  The `bug.java` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.java` shows the corrected version.
